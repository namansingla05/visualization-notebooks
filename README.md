# Data Visualization Practice with Matplotlib & Seaborn 

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks created during my practice with two powerful Python libraries: **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. It covers a variety of plotting techniques used for data exploration and presentation.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Matplotlib
- Line charts, bar plots, pie charts, histograms
- Subplots, titles, labels, legends, styling

### Seaborn
- Distribution plots (distplot, histplot, kdeplot)
- Categorical plots (boxplot, stripplot, swarmplot)
- Matrix plots (heatmap, clustermap)
- Regression plots and pairplots
- Themes and color palettes

### Combined Visualizations
- Using Matplotlib to style Seaborn plots
- Fine-tuning plots with Matplotlib's control over axes, ticks, and figures
